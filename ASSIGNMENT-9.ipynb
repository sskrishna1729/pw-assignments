    "## Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to run multiple threads (smaller units of execution) concurrently within a single process. Each thread represents a separate flow of execution, allowing multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously.\n",
    "## Multithreading is used to achieve concurrency and improve the responsiveness of applications. It allows for efficient utilization of system resources, particularly in scenarios where I/O operations or tasks with waiting periods are involved. By using threads, different parts of a program can execute concurrently, enabling faster execution and a smoother user experience.\n",
    "## The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. The threading module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. It offers various features and synchronization primitives, such as locks and semaphores, to coordinate the execution of threads and handle shared resources safely."
