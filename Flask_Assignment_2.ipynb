    "## GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. It retrieves data from the server, such as a web page, a file, or data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data in URL: In a GET request, data is appended to the URL as query parameters. This means that the data is visible in the URL, and it's limited in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching: GET requests can be cached by web browsers and intermediary servers, which can improve performance for subsequent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idempotent: GET requests are considered idempotent, which means that making the same GET request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once. It does not modify server state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: GET requests are generally considered safe because they do not alter data on the server. However, sensitive data should not be passed via query parameters in a URL due to visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples: Retrieving a web page, fetching search results, fetching an image, accessing a public API, and viewing product details on an e-commerce website are common uses of GET requests."

    "## POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by the identified resource. It sends data to the server for further processing, such as submitting a form, creating a new resource, or updating an existing resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data in Body: In a POST request, data is sent in the request body, not in the URL. This allows for larger amounts of data to be transmitted, including complex data structures like JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Cached: POST requests are not cached by browsers or intermediary servers, as they are intended for data modification and can have side effects on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Idempotent: POST requests are not idempotent. Making the same POST request multiple times can lead to different results or state changes on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: POST requests are suitable for handling sensitive data and user authentication. They provide a more secure way to send data compared to GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples: Submitting a registration form, sending a comment on a blog post, adding items to a shopping cart, or making changes to a user's profile information are common uses of POST requests."
